The setting can be made in several ways, using composer or through Drupal 8. Consider using composer.
In the composer.json file, you need to add a section with the repository
```
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "package",
            "package": {
                "name": "whdigger/import",
                "version": "master",
                "type":"drupal-custom-module",
                "source": {
                    "url": "https://github.com/whdigger/import.git",
                    "type": "git",
                    "reference": "master"
                }
            }
        }
    ],

        "installer-paths": {
            "web/modules/custom/{$name}": ["type:drupal-custom-module"]

```
0 * * * * cd /var/www/html && /usr/bin/drush cron 
```

Example of use
------------
To start using data import, you need to create a news entity that will import data from the RSS feed. To do this, go to the section Structure -> Material Types -> Add material type (/admin/structure/types/add)
Next, in the manage fields section, add fields: title, content, links, and file

You can then configure the import type.
In the structure section, you will see a new data type importer types (/admin/structure/importer_type/add) you need to create a data type, match the data import fields to the news entity fields, and select a unique key.

After the data type is created, you can proceed to creating the upload itself, a new item will appear in the content section (admin/content/importer) here you need to install a link to the RSS feed. After saving the data, go to the section (admin/content/importer) and select Import in the table in the operations column.
